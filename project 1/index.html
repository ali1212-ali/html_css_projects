                <h2>A Great Politician</h2>
                <p>
                    Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi[a] (born 5 October 1952) is a Pakistani politician, philanthropist, and
                    former cricketer who served as the 19th prime minister of Pakistan from August 2018 until April
                    2022. He is the founder and former chairman of the political party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI)
                    from 1996 to 2023.

                    Born in Lahore, Khan graduated from Keble College, Oxford. He began his international cricket career
                    in a 1971 Test series against England. Khan learned reverse swing bowling from Sarfraz Nawaz and
                    passed on this technique to Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis, who developed and popularised it in
                    subsequent years. He was named one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1983. Khan is also
                    credited with advancing the idea of neutral umpiring in cricket during his captaincy. Khan led
                    Pakistan to its first-ever Test series victories in India and England during 1987. He was awarded
                    the International Cricketer of the Year award in 1989. Playing until 1992, he captained the Pakistan
                    national cricket team for most of the 1980s and early 1990s. He initially decided to retire after
                    the 1987 Cricket World Cup.
